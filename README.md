# HNGStageZero

This repository contains code for the stage zero task of HNG12 internship, and can be accessed through https://github.com/BabaseunSylvester/HNGStageZero
This is code for a simple native Android mobile app which consists of just one screen containing a text and two buttons. 
The buttons each link to specific links; one, a link to this repository (https://github.com/BabaseunSylvester/HNGStageZero),
and the second, a link to the HNG Kotlin Developers page (https://hng.tech/hire/kotlin-developers).

To clone this app, click on the 'Code' button in this repository, then copy the hyperlink shown. 
Open Android Studio then navigate to File > New > Project from Version Control. 
A pop-up screen will then be shown; select 'Git' from the 'Version control' drop-down menu. Paste the copied repository hyperlink you copied then click on 'Clone'.

To build and run this app in the Android Studio IDE, you need to have this repository cloned and already open. 
Set up a target device (either a virtual device or you connect a physical Android mobile phone and enable USB debugging in its Developer settings). 
Select your target device from the devices dropdown menu. Click on 'Run' button then wait for the app to build.
